## About

- The main learning outcome of this project is to work with Active Record associations and create model relationships that make sense.

- The task is to create a site similar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then mange user signups.

- The project can be found on The Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events

### What I learned...
- when creating a `show` route aka `object#show`, this corresponds to a view for a specific instance of that object such as `users/(:id)`
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39113941/no-route-matches-action-show-controller-forum-missing-required-keys
- `through` associations and relations
- better understanding on routing, and the MVC process
